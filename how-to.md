## Connection Information

Server: __login.zenvera.com__ Port: __2593__

_Port 80 can be used as an alternative for those behind restrictive firewalls._

## Downloads

The game and assistant installers are free to obtain and do not contain any advertising or otherwise malicious software. They can be easily uninstalled at any time. We strongly suggest only obtaining them from the their official locations below:


1. [Ultima Online Classic](http://www.uo.com/Client-Download) ([License/TOS](https://help.ea.com/article/uo-terms-of-service) [Patching and Uninstallation Instructions](https://help.ea.com/article/patching-ultima-online)
2. UO Assistant (one of the following):
  * [Razor](https://github.com/msturgill/razor/releases/latest)
  * [UOSteam](http://uosteam.com)

## Installation

Install the Ultima Online Classic client by running the setup program. When the install is completed run Ultima Online from the shortcut created on your desktop to start the game patcher.

The patcher will ensure that your game is up-to-date and must be run to complete the installation.

Once the patcher has finished you can close the UO client. Install your UO assistant of choice. You can choose Razor, a classic UO assistant that has been around for a long time or UOSteam, which is a new UO assistant in active development.

_Whichever assistant you choose, please follow the installation instructions on their respective webpages. Razor requires the .NET framework to be installed and UOSteam requires the Visual C++ runtime._

## Account Creation

Accounts are automatically created when they are first used. If you do not have an account yet, simply log in with the username and password you desire. You can then continue on to create your first character.

_If you are issued an “Invalid password” error message when trying to create your account then that account name is likely already taken. If you are issued a “Problem communicating with Origin” error message, your IP address cannot create additional accounts. If your client gets stuck on “Verifying account”, then your IP address may have been firewalled or you are experiencing general network issues._

## Character Creation

You can create up to 5 characters per account. Each character has a skill limit and having multiple characters allows you to enjoy different play styles. The following new character presets are available on Zenvera: warrior, mage and blacksmith. To create your own customized skill template, choose custom.

_The client offers other presets when creating a new character, but as Zenvera is largely a classic UO shard, these presets cannot be chosen. You can only create Human characters._

Once your character is created you can continue into the world of Britannia. You will be prompted to register your account to an email address if you have not already done so. Registering an account is highly recommended. Your account must be registered with an email address in order to perform various account management actions such as changing a password or recovering a lost account. Your account must be registered to place or take ownership of a house on Zenvera.

That’s all there is to it! We hope you enjoy playing Zenvera!
